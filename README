I have designed a few knitting patterns in gimp. One pixel per
stitch works pretty well - until it's time to print the thing. This
script expands your pattern (scale factor is user selectable) and
draws it with black lines, thicker black lines every ten stitches.

Place the *.py script in your $HOME/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins directory (or
similar) then change it to executable:

chmod 755 *.py

It should show up under the Image menu.

On a Mac, the directory is now:

   $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/GIMP/2.8/plug-ins

Note: If you have an alpha channel, the results look weird.
Better to remove it.
